# BetterWindows - a solution to make Windows better, without need for reinstall

Windows sucks these days... There are actually people who will use it. You probably don't want to switch to a different operating system, but you want to make it a little better. If that describes you - go and download the project.

## Installing

> [!WARNING]
> If `DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth` prints something with `The component store`, it means that BetterWindows won't work as good as on a clean device. Please reinstall Windows before continuing.

Go to GitHub releases on this project (Releases tab) and download the latest executable.
